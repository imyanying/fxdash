## Introduction
I built this dashboard to make it easier to compare currency movements in a simpler, more visual way. I'm not an FX trader, so I don't need to track real-time fluctuations. Instead, I'm more interested in observing how currencies respond to global and domestic economic news or political events, as well as their longer-term trends.
Since I focus on APAC major economies at work, the sample currencies I used are from this region. With so many currencies involved, putting everything on one chart would get messy, so I decided to use subplots. This makes it easier for me to analyze individual currencies while comparing their movements with other APAC peers.
I built this using Python, Plotly, and Yahoo Finance. The dashboard is saved as an HTML file, which allows the charts to remain interactive when viewed in a local browser.
